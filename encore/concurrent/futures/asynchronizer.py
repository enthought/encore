class Asynchronizer(object):
    """
    Allows 'forgetful' submission of operations, giving a convenient
    pattern for some asynchronous use-cases.

    The Asynchronizer executes at most a single operation at a time.  Requests
    to `submit` a new operation while an operation is executed are stored for
    future execution, with each new submission overwriting the prior.  When a
    running operation completes, the most recent submission (if one exists) is
    then executed. Therefore, operations submitted between the previous and
    current execution are discarded.  The last operation submitted is
    guaranteed to eventually be executed.

    If a callable `callback` is provided, it will be called whenever an
    execution completes.  The callback must accept as its only argument the
    Future that encapsulates the job.  (The Future objects used by the
    Asynchronizer are otherwise private.) Exceptions raised within the callback
    will be logged and suppressed.  See the `concurrent.futures` documentation
    for more information about Future callbacks.
