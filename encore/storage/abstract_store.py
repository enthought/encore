Key-Value Store API
===================

This module specifies the key-value store API for the various package management and
installation systems that are in use at Enthought and our clients.

The key-value store API exposes an interface on top of whatever
backend implementation is used by subclasses.  This permits code which requires
access to a key-value store to use it in a uniform way without having to care about
where and how the data is stored.  The API is also agnostic about what is being
stored, and so while the key use case is for egg repositories, potentially any
data values can be stored in the key-value store.
