""" This module defines a file based lock.

The `FileLock` is implemented by creating a file in the specified directory,
with some content to identify the host/process which acquired the lock.

The `FileLock` is also expected to work on NFS shared directories, in
Linux kernel version 2.6.5 and above.

Basic Usage
-----------

::

    lock = FileLock('resource_1', '/tmp')
    lock.acquire()
    lock.release()

    slock = SharedFileLock('resource_1', '/tmp')
    slock.acquire()
    slock2 = SharedFileLock('resource_1', '/tmp')
    slock2.acquire() # Succeeds because lock is shared.

        Parameters
        ----------
        name - str
            An identifier for the lock.
        dir - str
            The directory where the lock file is stored.
        poll_interval - float
            The interval to check for change in status of the lock.
        timeout - float
            The time to wait before failing to acquire a lock.
        force_timeout - float
            The time to wait before forcefully breaking a lock.
        uid - str or None
            A unique identifier for the lock. This will uniquely identify a
            lock within the same process. For example, a filesystem store
            could use its id as the identifier, so that all lock instances
            behave same within the store but any other store instance will
            have a different lock. If the uid is None, then the id of the
            lock instance is used, which means every lock instance is unique.
        data - str or None
            The data to add to the lock file that can be used to obtain 
            details about the locking process.  If set to None, this adds
            a default set of values as the hostname, pid, username and given
            uid to the lock file.  This data is also used to check if 
            a different process is releasing the lock.

        Notes
        -----
        The lock is not released when it is garbage collected to avoid
        erroneous release when used as anonymous lock within a `with`
        context. Hence always use it within a `with` context to avoid
        stale unreleased locks.
