        buffer_size : int
            An optional indicator of the number of bytes to read at a time.

            periodically as data is written to the underlying store.

        """ Provide a transaction context manager
        
        Implementations which have no native notion of transactions may choose
        not to implement this.
        
        This method provides a context manager which creates a data store
        transaction in its __enter__() method, and commits it in its __exit__()
        method if no errors occur.  Intended usage is::
        
            with repo.transaction("Writing data..."):
                # everything written in this block is part of the transaction
                ...
            
        If the block exits without error, the transaction commits, otherwise
        the transaction should roll back the state of the underlying data store
        to the start of the transaction.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        notes : string
            Some information about the transaction, which may or may not be used
            by the implementation.
        
        Returns
        -------

        StoreTransactionEndEvent :
            This event should be emitted on successful conclusion of the
            transaction, before any Set or Delete events are emitted.
        StoreSetEvent :
            On successful completion of a transaction, a StoreSetEvent should be

            transaction.
