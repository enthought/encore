<h1>Key-Value Store Concepts<a class="headerlink" href="#key-value-store-concepts" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>The key-value store API exposes an interface on top of whatever
backend implementation is used by subclasses.  This permits code which requires
access to a key-value store to use it in a uniform way without having to care about
where and how the data is stored.  The API is also agnostic about what is being
stored, and so while the key use case is for egg repositories, potentially any
data values can be stored in the key-value store.</p>
<section id="discussion">
<h2>Discussion<a class="headerlink" href="#discussion" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>We have seen a common need throughout client and internal development efforts at
Enthought for various ways of persistently storing data and associated metadata
and making it available within the applications we write.  Over the years,
Enthought has implemented a number of different storage systems with similar
general functionality; sometimes even with multiple ones in the same project.
The particular motivation which has prompted the creation of the storage API,
and the initial use-case is a refactor of the Enstaller project to provide a
cleaner set of internal APIs.</p>
<p>When faced with a problem like this, it is tempting to start from the
implementation level and build a solution to the problem at hand (eg. “I need to
store eggs, so I build an egg store”).  In generalizing, it is then even more
tempting to try to replace existing implementations with a more generic
implementation (eg. “I need to store eggs and apps and code blocks both locally
and remotely, so I build a NoSQL-backed data store server which I can run
locally if I need to”).  However any generic implementation must make
trade-offs, and the trade-offs may end up being inappropriate for particular use
cases (eg. “Now I need to have an in-memory code-block store for efficiency, and
my store’s optimized for remote access…”).</p>
<div class="graphviz"><img src="../_images/graphviz-a030b2145aa0789d38ba654e79d07c456ee24b3b.png" alt="digraph diagram1 {
node [shape=box, fontname=sans, fontsize=10, height=0.1, width=0.1]
&quot;Egg Store&quot; -&gt; &quot;General Implementation&quot;;
&quot;Code Block Store&quot; -&gt; &quot;General Implementation&quot;;
&quot;Configuration Store&quot; -&gt; &quot;General Implementation&quot;
}" class="graphviz" /></div>
<p>Alternatively, it is tempting to start from the task that is being attempted
(eg. “I need to store eggs, so I build an egg store”) and then generalize the
implementation (eg. “Now I need to store eggs remotely, so I’ll build a remote
egg store, but at least I’ll use the same API”).  However, again the specifics
of the implementation may make it inappropriate for particular use cases (eg.
“Now I need a code-block store, so I’ll wrap up my code-blocks as eggs and use
an egg store… but now they’re 100 times bigger than they need to be…”)</p>
<div class="graphviz"><img src="../_images/graphviz-f0897afcb810a3cf2c41d6dedc8788b129825d2a.png" alt="digraph diagram2 {
node [shape=box, fontname=sans, fontsize=10, height=0.1, width=0.1]
&quot;Egg Store API&quot; -&gt; &quot;Memory Store&quot;
&quot;Egg Store API&quot; -&gt; &quot;Disk Store&quot;
&quot;Egg Store API&quot; -&gt; &quot;HTTP Store&quot;
&quot;Egg Store API&quot; -&gt; &quot;Cached Store&quot;
&quot;Egg Store API&quot; -&gt; &quot;SQL Store&quot;
}" class="graphviz" /></div>
<p>This storage API instead to simply provides an API through which data providers
and data consumers can talk.  The API deliberately makes no assumptions about
what is being stored (eg. eggs vs. code blocks) but also makes no assumptions
about how the data is stored (eg. in memory, on disk, in a database, through a
remote server).  This allows developers to re-use code more efficiently by
permitting them to choose the pieces that make sense for their particular use
case (eg. “I need an in-memory code-block store, so I’ll take my general
code-block store logic which uses the API, and my in-memory store logic which
implements the API, and join them together”).  Not every combination may make
sense (an in-memory egg store is probably a bad idea, for example), but the
ability to pick and choose allows a great deal of flexibility.</p>
<div class="graphviz"><img src="../_images/graphviz-7d3cd4f7dbf0e8cf178191f426f9f0fde8f94362.png" alt="digraph diagram2 {
node [shape=box, fontname=sans, fontsize=10, height=0.1, width=0.1]
&quot;Egg Store&quot; -&gt; &quot;Key-Value Store API&quot;
&quot;Code Block Store&quot; -&gt; &quot;Key-Value Store API&quot;
&quot;Configuration Store&quot; -&gt; &quot;Key-Value Store API&quot;
&quot;Key-Value Store API&quot; -&gt; &quot;Memory Store&quot;
&quot;Key-Value Store API&quot; -&gt; &quot;Disk Store&quot;
&quot;Key-Value Store API&quot; -&gt; &quot;HTTP Store&quot;
&quot;Key-Value Store API&quot; -&gt; &quot;Cached Store&quot;
&quot;Key-Value Store API&quot; -&gt; &quot;SQL Store&quot;
}" class="graphviz" /></div>
<p>This also reflects the reality that developers frequently do not have complete
freedom to choose the best possible data store solution due to external
constraints.  By writing to the storage API, you have the opportunity to more
easily re-use components, as well as the possibility of later replacing the
sub-optimal solution with a better one.</p>
<p>This approach also allows developers to write general connectors, adapters and
other building blocks for repositories which only use the API and don’t care
about what is being stored.  This should permit fast prototyping of
functionality, if nothing else, but in many cases this approach may be good
enough for production code.  For example, a generic joined store could be
written which takes a list of other stores which implement the API and when
asked for data from the store asks each store in sequence for the data until it
finds what is requested.  To code using the joined store, it appears just like
any other store, and the joined store doesn’t care how the stores it joins are
implemented.</p>
</section>
<section id="keys">
<h2>Keys<a class="headerlink" href="#keys" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The keys of the key-value store are strings, and the key-value store API makes no
assumptions about what the strings represent or any structure they might have.
In particular keys are assumed to be case sensitive and may include arbitrary
characters, so key-value store implementations should be careful to handle any issues
which may arise if the underlying data store is case insensitive and has special
characters which need to be escaped.</p>
<p>Each key has associated with it a collection of metadata and some binary data.
The key-value store API makes no assumptions about how the metadata and data is
serialized.</p>
</section>
<section id="values">
<h2>Values<a class="headerlink" href="#values" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The values stored in the key-value store consist of two parts, a binary data
stream and a metadata dictionary.  These are encapsulated into a light-weight
data-structure which can hold additional implementation-specific information.</p>
<p>In particular, implementations should expose attributes or properties ‘size’,
‘created’ and ‘modified’ which proved the number of bytes in the data stream,
the creation time of the key, and the most recent modification time of the key.
These additional attributes are primarily provided for internal use and to assist
composition and replication of key-value stores.</p>
<p>The Value should contain enough information to extract the data and metadata,
but does not have to actually open those resources until they are requested.</p>
<p>For writable repositories, data should be supplied to keys via a Value subclass,
if possible.  This allows copying between repositories using code like:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">repo1</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">set</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">key</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">repo1</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">key</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>or copying between keys with code like:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">repo</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">set</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">key1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">repo</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">key2</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Since files are likely to be common targets for extracting data from values, or
sources for data being stored, the key-value store API provides utility methods
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">to_file()</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">from_file()</span></code>.  Simple default implementations of these methods are
provided, but implementations of the key-value store API may be able to override
these to be more efficient, depending on the nature of the back-end data store.</p>
<p>For backwards compatibility, value objects express an API that makes them appear
as a 2-tuple of (data, metadata).</p>
</section>
<section id="data">
<h2>Data<a class="headerlink" href="#data" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The binary data stored in the values is presented through the key-value store API as
file-like objects which implement at least read(), close(), __enter__() and
__exit__() methods as well as having attributes which provide some amount of
information about the stream, such as length, last modification time, creation
time, and so forth.  Particular backends may choose to provide additional
attributes or implement additional methods as needed.</p>
<p>Frequently this will be a wrapper around a standard file, StringIO object, a
urllib file-like object or other wrapper about a socket.  The read() method
should accept an optional number of bytes to read, so that buffered reads can be
performed.</p>
<p>The key-value store API gives no special meaning to the bytes stored in the value.
However care should be taken that it is in fact bytes being stored, and not a
(possibly unicode) string; in particular, if an actual file is being used it should
be opened in binary mode.</p>
</section>
<section id="metadata">
<h2>Metadata<a class="headerlink" href="#metadata" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Metadata should be representable as a dictionary whose keys are valid Python
identifiers, and whose values can be serialized into reasonable human-readable
form (basically, you should be able to represent the dictionary as JSON, XML,
YAML, or similar in a clear and sane way, because some underlying datastore
<em>will</em>).</p>
<p>Metadata can be retrieved via the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">get_metadata()</span></code> method or as the second element
of the tuple returned by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">get()</span></code>.  Metadata can be set using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">set()</span></code> or
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">set_metadata()</span></code> and existing metadata can be modified using
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">update_metadata()</span></code> (similarly to the way that the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">update()</span></code> method works
for dictionaries).</p>
<p>There is nothing that ensures that metadata and the corresponding data are
synchronised for a particular object.  It is up to the user of the API to ensure
that the metadata for stored data is correct.</p>
<p>We currently make no assumptions about the metadata keys, but we expect
conventions to evolve for the meanings and format of particular keys.  Given
that this is generally thought of as a repository for storing eggs, the
following metadata keys are likely to be available:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><dl class="simple">
<dt>type</dt><dd><p>The type of object being stored (package, app, patch, video, etc.).</p>
</dd>
<dt>name</dt><dd><p>The name of the object being stored.</p>
</dd>
<dt>version</dt><dd><p>The version of the object being stored.</p>
</dd>
<dt>arch</dt><dd><p>The architecture that the object being stored is for.</p>
</dd>
<dt>python</dt><dd><p>The version of Python that the object being stored is for.</p>
</dd>
<dt>ctime</dt><dd><p>The creation time of the object in the repository in seconds since
the Unix Epoch.</p>
</dd>
<dt>mtime</dt><dd><p>The last modification time of the object in the repository in seconds
since the Unix Epoch.</p>
</dd>
<dt>size</dt><dd><p>The size of the binary data in bytes.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Note that there is a difference in intent between the information stored in the
metadata and the attributes on the value object: value object attributes are
controlled by the key-value store implementation, whereas metadata are completely
arbitrary from the point of view of the key-value store and are completely up
to the user code as to what information is stored.</p>
</section>
<section id="connecting-and-disconnecting">
<h2>Connecting and Disconnecting<a class="headerlink" href="#connecting-and-disconnecting" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Before a store can be used, its <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">connect()</span></code> method must be called to allow any
long-lived resources to be allocated and prepared for use, and to optionally
handle any authentication that might be required.</p>
<p>Conversely, the store’s <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">disconnect()</span></code> method should be called when code is
done with the store, allowing it to release any long-lived resources.</p>
</section>
<section id="querying">
<h2>Querying<a class="headerlink" href="#querying" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>A very simple querying API is provided by default.  The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">query()</span></code> method simply
takes a collection of keyword arguments and interprets them as metadata keys
and values.  It returns all the keys and corresponding metadata that match all
of the supplied arguments.  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">query_keys()</span></code> does the same, but only returns the
matching keys.</p>
<p>Subclasses may choose to provide more sophisticated querying mechanisms.</p>
</section>
<section id="transactions">
<h2>Transactions<a class="headerlink" href="#transactions" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The base abstract key-value store has no notion of transactions, since we want to
handle the read-only and simple writer cases efficiently.  However, if the
underlying storage mechanism has the notion of a transaction, this can be
encapsulated by writing a context manager for transactions.  The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">transaction()</span></code>
method returns an instance of the appropriate context manager.</p>
</section>
<section id="events">
<h2>Events<a class="headerlink" href="#events" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>All implementations should have an event manager attribute, and may choose to
emit appropriate events.  This is of particular importance during long-running
interactions so that progress can be displayed.  This also provides a mechanism
that an implementation can use to inform listeners that new objects have been
added, or the store has been otherwise modified.</p>
